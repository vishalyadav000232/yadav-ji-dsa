# 📦 Arrays – DSA Fundamentals (Yadav Ji DSA)

## 📌 Overview
Arrays are the **foundation of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
Almost every advanced topic (strings, sliding window, two pointers, DP, graphs) is built on array concepts.

This folder focuses on **clear fundamentals, Python implementation, and interview-ready understanding**.

## 🧠 What is an Array?
An **array** is a **linear data structure** that:
- Stores elements of the **same data type**
- Stores data in **contiguous memory locations**
- Allows **direct access using index**
- Preserves **order of elements**

📍 Example (Python):
```python
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40]
